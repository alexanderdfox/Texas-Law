    (j)  In devising the audit plan under Subsection (c), the State Auditor shall perform risk assessments as required by law.  The process of assessing risks to the state is the first stage of auditing, and all records of risk assessment are part of the working papers of the State Auditor.  Accordingly, all documentation of risk assessments by the State Auditor is exempt from disclosure under Section [552.116](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.116).
