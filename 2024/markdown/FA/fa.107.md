    (c)  An attorney appointed to serve in the dual role may request the court to appoint another person to serve as guardian ad litem for the child.  If the court grants the attorney's request, the attorney shall serve only as the attorney ad litem for the child.
    
    (d)  Unless the court appoints another person as guardian ad litem in a suit filed by a governmental entity, an appointment of an attorney to serve as an attorney ad litem in a suit filed by a governmental entity is an appointment to serve in the dual role regardless of the terminology used in the appointing order.
