    (6)  suspending the operation of all or part of the property division that is being appealed.
    
    (b)  A temporary order under this section enjoining a party from dissipating or transferring the property awarded to the other party in the trial court's property division:
    
    (1)  may be rendered without:

    (3)  may not prohibit a party's use, transfer, conveyance, or dissipation of the property awarded to the other party in the trial court's property division if the use, transfer, conveyance, or dissipation of the property is for the purpose of suspending the enforcement of the property division that is the subject of the appeal.
    
    (c)  A temporary order under this section that suspends the operation of all or part of the property division that is the subject of the appeal may not be rendered unless the trial court takes reasonable steps to ensure that the party awarded property in the trial court's property division is protected from the other party's dissipation or transfer of that property.
    
    (d)  In considering a party's request to suspend the enforcement of the property division, the trial court shall consider whether:
    
    (1)  any relief granted under Subsection (a) is adequate to protect the party's interest in the property awarded to the party; or
    
    (2)  the party who was not awarded the property should also be required to provide security for the appeal in addition to any relief granted under Subsection (a).
    
    (e)  If the trial court determines that the party awarded the property can be adequately protected from the other party's dissipation of assets during the appeal only if the other party provides security for the appeal, the trial court shall set the appropriate amount of security, taking into consideration any relief granted under Subsection (a) and the amount of security that the other party would otherwise have to provide by law if relief under Subsection (a) was not granted.
    
    (f)  In rendering a temporary order under this section that suspends enforcement of all or part of the property division, the trial court may grant any relief under Subsection (a), in addition to requiring the party who was not awarded the property to post security for that part of the property division to be suspended.  The trial court may require that the party who was not awarded the property post all or only part of the security that would otherwise be required by law.
    
    (g)  This section does not prevent a party who was not awarded the property from exercising that party's right to suspend the enforcement of the property division as provided by law.
