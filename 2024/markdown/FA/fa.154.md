    (c)  For purposes of this section, the court of continuing jurisdiction shall determine the amount of the unpaid child support obligation for each child of the deceased obligor.  In determining the amount of the unpaid child support obligation, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including:
    
    (1)  the present value of the total amount of monthly periodic child support payments that would become due between the month in which the obligor dies and the month in which the child turns 18 years of age, based on the amount of the periodic monthly child support payments under the child support order in effect on the date of the obligor's death;
    
    (2)  the present value of the total amount of health insurance and dental insurance premiums payable for the benefit of the child from the month in which the obligor dies until the month in which the child turns 18 years of age, based on the cost of health insurance and dental insurance for the child ordered to be paid on the date of the obligor's death;
    
    (3)  in the case of a disabled child under 18 years of age or an adult disabled child, an amount to be determined by the court under Section [154.306](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=154.306);
    
    (4)  the nature and amount of any benefit to which the child would be entitled as a result of the obligor's death, including life insurance proceeds, annuity payments, trust distributions, social security death benefits, and retirement survivor benefits; and
    
    (5)  any other financial resource available for the support of the child.
    
    (d)  If, after considering all relevant factors, the court finds that the child support obligation has been satisfied, the court shall render an order terminating the child support obligation.  If the court finds that the child support obligation is not satisfied, the court shall render a judgment in favor of the obligee, for the benefit of the child, in the amount of the unpaid child support obligation determined under Subsection (c).  The order must designate the obligee as constructive trustee, for the benefit of the child, of any money received in satisfaction of the judgment.
    
    (e)  The obligee has a claim, on behalf of the child, against the deceased obligor's estate for the unpaid child support obligation determined under Subsection (c).  The obligee may present the claim in the manner provided by the Estates Code.
    
    (f)  If money paid to the obligee for the benefit of the child exceeds the amount of the unpaid child support obligation remaining at the time of the obligor's death, the obligee shall hold the excess amount as constructive trustee for the benefit of the deceased obligor's estate until the obligee delivers the excess amount to the legal representative of the deceased obligor's estate.

    Sec. 154.125.  APPLICATION OF GUIDELINES TO NET RESOURCES.  (a)  The guidelines for the support of a child in this section are specifically designed to apply to situations in which the obligor's monthly net resources are not greater than the maximum amount of net resources to which the statutory guidelines are applicable, as most recently published by the Title IV-D agency in the Texas Register.
    
    (a-1)  The amount prescribed by Subsection (a) is adjusted every six years as necessary to reflect inflation.  The Title IV-D agency shall compute the adjusted amount, to take effect beginning September 1 of the year of the adjustment, based on the percentage change in the consumer price index during the 72-month period preceding March 1 of the year of the adjustment, as rounded to the nearest $50 increment.  The Title IV-D agency shall publish the adjusted amount in the Texas Register before September 1 of the year in which the adjustment takes effect.  For purposes of this subsection, "consumer price index" has the meaning assigned by Section [341.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=341.201), Finance Code.

(a)  If the obligor's net resources exceed the amount provided by Section [154.125](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=154.125)(a), the court shall presumptively apply the percentage guidelines to the portion of the obligor's net resources that does not exceed that amount.  Without further reference to the percentage recommended by these guidelines, the court may order additional amounts of child support as appropriate, depending on the income of the parties and the proven needs of the child.
    
    (b)  The proper calculation of a child support order that exceeds the presumptive amount established for the portion of the obligor's net resources provided by Section [154.125](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=154.125)(a) requires that the entire amount of the presumptive award be subtracted from the proven total needs of the child.  After the presumptive award is subtracted, the court shall allocate between the parties the responsibility to meet the additional needs of the child according to the circumstances of the parties.  However, in no event may the obligor be required to pay more child support than the greater of the presumptive amount or the amount equal to 100 percent of the proven needs of the child.

    (1)  determine the amount of child support that would be ordered if all children whom the obligor has the legal duty to support lived in one household by applying the schedule in this subchapter;
    
    (2)  compute a child support credit for the obligor's children who are not before the court by dividing the amount determined under Subdivision (1) by the total number of children whom the obligor is obligated to support and multiplying that number by the number of the obligor's children who are not before the court;
    
    (3)  determine the adjusted net resources of the obligor by subtracting the child support credit computed under Subdivision (2) from the net resources of the obligor;  and
    
    (4)  determine the child support amount for the children before the court by applying the percentage guidelines for one household for the number of children of the obligor before the court to the obligor's adjusted net resources.
    
    (b)  For the purpose of determining a child support credit, the total number of an obligor's children includes the children before the court for the establishment or modification of a support order and any other children, including children residing with the obligor, whom the obligor has the legal duty of support.
    
    (c)  The child support credit with respect to children for whom the obligor is obligated by an order to pay support is computed, regardless of whether the obligor is delinquent in child support payments, without regard to the amount of the order.

    Sec. 154.131.  RETROACTIVE CHILD SUPPORT.  (a)  The child support guidelines are intended to guide the court in determining the amount of retroactive child support, if any, to be ordered.
    
    (b)  In ordering retroactive child support, the court shall consider the net resources of the obligor during the relevant time period and whether:
    
    (1)  the mother of the child had made any previous attempts to notify the obligor of his paternity or probable paternity;
    
    (2)  the obligor had knowledge of his paternity or probable paternity;
    
    (3)  the order of retroactive child support will impose an undue financial hardship on the obligor or the obligor's family;  and
    
    (4)  the obligor has provided actual support or other necessaries before the filing of the action.
    
    (c)  It is presumed that a court order limiting the amount of retroactive child support to an amount that does not exceed the total amount of support that would have been due for the four years preceding the date the petition seeking support was filed is reasonable and in the best interest of the child.
    
    (d)  The presumption created under this section may be rebutted by evidence that the obligor:
    
    (1)  knew or should have known that the obligor was the father of the child for whom support is sought;  and
    
    (2)  sought to avoid the establishment of a support obligation to the child.
    
    (e)  An order under this section limiting the amount of retroactive support does not constitute a variance from the guidelines requiring the court to make specific findings under Section [154.130](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=154.130).
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, the court retains jurisdiction to render an order for retroactive child support in a suit if a petition requesting retroactive child support is filed not later than the fourth anniversary of the date of the child's 18th birthday.

    (b)  If a child for whom the obligor owes child support receives a lump-sum payment as a result of the obligor's disability and that payment is made to the obligee as the representative payee of the child, the credit for the lump-sum payment must be applied as provided by Section [157.009](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=157.009).

(a)  The court shall consider the cost, accessibility, and quality of health insurance coverage available to the parties and shall give priority to health insurance coverage available through the employment of one of the parties if the coverage is available at a reasonable cost to the obligor.
    
    (b)  In determining the manner in which health care coverage for the child is to be ordered, the court shall render its order in accordance with the following priorities, unless a party shows good cause why a particular order would not be in the best interest of the child:
    
    (1)  if health insurance is available for the child through a parent's employment or membership in a union, trade association, or other organization at reasonable cost, the court shall order that parent to include the child in the parent's health insurance;

    (3)  if health insurance coverage is not available for the child under Subdivision (1) or (2), the court shall order the obligor to pay the obligee, in addition to any amount ordered under the guidelines for child support, an amount, not to exceed nine percent of the obligor's annual resources, as described by Section [154.062](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=154.062)(b), as cash medical support for the child.
    
    (b-1)  If the parent ordered to provide health insurance under Subsection (b)(1) or (2) is the obligee, the court shall order the obligor to pay the obligee, as additional child support, an amount equal to the actual cost of health insurance for the child, but not to exceed a reasonable cost to the obligor.  In calculating the actual cost of health insurance for the child, if the obligee has other minor dependents covered under the same health insurance plan, the court shall divide the total cost to the obligee for the insurance by the total number of minor dependents, including the child covered under the plan.
    
    (b-2)  If the court finds that neither parent has access to private health insurance at a reasonable cost to the obligor, the court shall order the parent awarded the exclusive right to designate the child's primary residence or, to the extent permitted by law, the other parent to apply immediately on behalf of the child for participation in a government medical assistance program or health plan.  If the child participates in a government medical assistance program or health plan, the court shall order cash medical support under Subsection (b)(3).
    
    (b-3)  An order requiring the payment of cash medical support under Subsection (b)(3) must allow the obligor to discontinue payment of the cash medical support if:
    
    (1)  health insurance for the child becomes available to the obligor at a reasonable cost; and
    
    (2)  the obligor:
    
    (A)  enrolls the child in the insurance plan; and

    (c)  The director of the Title IV-D agency may establish an advisory committee to consult with the director regarding the implementation and operation of the program.

The notification must specify a date beginning on which children may be enrolled in the program.
    
    (l)  On or after the date specified in the notification required by Subsection (k), a court that orders health care coverage for a child in a Title IV-D case shall order that the child be enrolled in the program authorized by this section unless other health insurance is available for the child at reasonable cost, including the state child health plan under Chapter [62](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=62), Health and Safety Code.
