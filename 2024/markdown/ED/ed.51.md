(a)  The governing board of every state institution of higher education is directed to designate special depository banks, subject to the approval of the comptroller, for the purpose of receiving and keeping certain receipts of the institution separate and apart from funds now deposited in the state treasury.  The receipts here referred to are described in Subsection (b) of this section.  The comptroller is directed to deposit the receipts, or funds representing such receipts, enumerated herein, in the special depository bank or banks nearest the institution credited with the receipts, so far as is practicable, and is authorized to withdraw such funds on drafts or checks prescribed by the comptroller. The comptroller is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to require collateral security for the protection of such funds pursuant to the provisions of Chapter [404](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=404), Government Code. For the purpose of facilitating the clearance and collection of the receipts herein enumerated, the comptroller is hereby authorized to deposit such receipts in any state depository bank and transfer funds representing such receipts enumerated herein to the respective special depository banks.  Banks so designated as special depository banks are hereby authorized to pledge their securities to protect such funds.
    
    (b)  The governing board of every state institution of higher education shall deposit in the state treasury all cash receipts accruing to any college or university under its control that may be derived from all sources except auxiliary enterprises, noninstructional services, agency, designated, and restricted funds, endowment and other gift funds, student loan funds, funds retained under Chapter [145](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=145) of this code, and Constitutional College Building Amendment funds.  The comptroller is directed to credit such receipts deposited by each such institution to a separate fund account for the institution depositing the receipts, but he shall not be required to keep separate accounts of types of funds deposited by each institution.  For the purpose of facilitating the transferring of such institutional receipts to the state treasury, each institution shall open in a local depository bank a clearing account to which it shall deposit daily all such receipts, and shall, not less often than every seven days, make remittances therefrom to the comptroller of all except $500 of the total balance in said clearing account, such remittances to be in the form of checks drawn on the clearing account by the duly authorized officers of the institution, and no disbursements other than remittances to the state treasury shall be made from such clearing account.  All money so deposited in the state treasury shall be paid out on warrants drawn by the comptroller as provided by law.
    
    (c)  The legislature is authorized to create revolving funds for the handling of funds of institutions of higher education, as enumerated herein, by making provision in each biennial appropriation bill enacted by the legislature.
    
    (d)  Nothing in this section affects the provisions of Title 47, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, usually referred to as the State Depository Law.  However, the limitation of deposits contained in Article 2532, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, shall not apply insofar as the specific funds enumerated in this section are concerned.
    
    (e)  This section prevails over Sections 51.001-51.007 of this code to the extent of any conflict.
    
    (f)  Interest earned on the receipts deposited under this section to an institution's separate fund account in the state treasury shall be credited to that separate fund account.
    
    (g)  Revenues collected at institutions of higher education and deposited in the state treasury pursuant to this section and Section [34.017](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=34.017), Natural Resources Code, and the interest earned thereon, are dedicated to the institution which collected and deposited the funds irrespective of the year the funds were collected, deposited, or earned.  These funds may be only used for the support, maintenance, and operation of the institution as provided for by law.  Section 403.094(h), Government Code, does not apply to funds described in this section.
    
    (h)  Tuition revenues and revenue collected under Section [34.017](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=34.017), Natural Resources Code, that are deposited in the treasury pursuant to this section, and the interest earned on those revenues, shall be treated as designated funds in the general revenue fund.  Notwithstanding a pledge of those revenues made or to be made in the proceedings approved by the governing board of an institution of higher education authorizing the issuance or incurrence of bonds, the deposit of those revenues in the treasury to the credit of an account in the general revenue fund does not:
    
    (1)  affect in any manner the pledge of the revenues or the governing board's ability to pledge the revenues to secure and pay bonds issued or incurred by the governing board in accordance with law;
    
    (2)  cause the bonds to constitute a debt of the state or be payable from the full faith and credit of the state;
    
    (3)  change the character of the revenues as separate revenue of the institution collecting the revenue;  or

    Sec. 51.101.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:
    
    (1)  "Institution of higher education" has the meaning assigned to it in Section [61.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.003) of this code, except that Texas State Technical College System is included and the Rodent and Predatory Animal Control Service is excluded for the purposes of this subchapter.

    Sec. 51.102.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The legislature finds that higher education is vitally important to the welfare, if not the survival, of Texas and the United States at this stage in history and that the quality of higher education is dependent upon the quality of college and university faculties.  The legislature finds, therefore, that money spent on recognized means for producing an excellent system of public higher education is money spent to serve a public purpose of great importance.  The legislature finds further that a sound program of faculty development leaves of absence designed to enable the faculty member to engage in study, research, writing, and similar projects for the purpose of adding to the knowledge available to himself, his students, his institution, and society generally is a well-recognized means for improving a state's program of public higher education.  The legislature's purpose in establishing the faculty development leave program provided for by this subchapter is to improve further the higher education available to the youth at the state-supported colleges and universities and to establish this program of faculty development leaves as part of the plan of compensation for the faculty of these colleges and universities.

    (b)  The governing board by regulation shall establish a procedure whereby the applications for faculty development leaves of absence are received by a committee elected by the general faculty for evaluation and whereby this faculty committee then makes recommendations to the chief administrative officer of the institution of higher education, who shall then make recommendations to the governing board as to which applications should be granted.

    (b)  A faculty member on faculty development leave may accept a grant for study, research, or travel from any institution of higher education, from a charitable, religious, or educational corporation or foundation, from any business enterprise, or from any federal, state, or local governmental agency.  An accounting of all grants shall be made to the governing board of the institution by the faculty member.

    Sec. 51.2125.  PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS:  AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO MUTUAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT.  (a)  This section applies only to a private institution of higher education that has under its control and jurisdiction property that is contiguous to, or located in any part within the boundaries of, a home-rule municipality that has a population of 1.18 million or more and is located predominantly in a county that has a total area of less than 1,000 square miles.  For purposes of this section, a private institution of higher education is a private or independent institution of higher education as defined by Section [61.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.003).
    
    (b)  In addition to exercising the authority provided under Section [51.212](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=51.212)(d), the governing board of a private institution of higher education to which this section applies and the governing body of each municipality, regardless of the municipality's population, that is contiguous to, or the boundaries of which contain any part of, property under the control and jurisdiction of the private institution of higher education may enter into a written mutual assistance agreement in which peace officers commissioned by the institution or the applicable municipality serve the public interest by assisting, without any form of additional compensation or other financial benefit, the peace officers of the other party to the agreement in enforcing state or local law, including applicable municipal ordinances.  The agreement must be reviewed at least annually by the institution and the municipality and may be modified at that time by a written agreement signed by each party.  The agreement may be terminated at any time by a party to the agreement on the provision of reasonable notice to the other party to the agreement.
    
    (c)  A mutual assistance agreement authorized by this section may designate the geographic area in which the campus peace officers are authorized to provide assistance to the peace officers of the municipality, except that if the agreement is entered into with a municipality described by Subsection (a) that elects all or part of the municipality's governing body from election districts, the designated geographic area consists of each of the election districts of the municipality's governing body that contains any part of the campus of the institution and each of the election districts of the governing body that is contiguous to another municipality that contains any part of the campus of the institution.
    
    (d)  This section does not affect a municipality's duty to provide law enforcement services to any location within the boundaries of the municipality.
    
    (e)  A peace officer providing assistance under a mutual assistance agreement authorized by this section may make arrests and exercise all other authority given to peace officers under other state law.  The municipal law enforcement agency has exclusive authority to supervise any campus peace officer operating under the agreement to assist the peace officers of the municipality.  A municipal peace officer operating under the agreement to assist the campus peace officers remains under the supervision of the municipal law enforcement agency.
    
    (f)  In the same manner and to the same extent as a municipality is liable for an act or omission of a peace officer employed by the municipality, a private institution of higher education is liable for an act or omission of a campus peace officer operating under a mutual assistance agreement authorized by this section at a location other than property under the control and jurisdiction of the institution.
    
    (g)  This section does not limit the authority of a campus peace officer to make a warrantless arrest outside the officer's jurisdiction as described by Article [14.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=14.03)(d), Code of Criminal Procedure.

    Sec. 51.2126.  APPEAL BY CAMPUS PEACE OFFICER OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR PROMOTIONAL BYPASS RELATED TO PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE UNDER MUTUAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT.  (a)  A campus peace officer acting under a mutual assistance agreement authorized by Section [51.2125](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=51.2125) who is demoted, suspended, or terminated by the applicable private institution of higher education or who experiences a promotional bypass by the institution may elect to appeal the institution's action to an independent third party hearing examiner under this section.
    
    (b)  To elect to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner under this section, the campus peace officer must submit to the head of the institution's law enforcement agency not later than the 30th day after the date of the action being appealed a written request stating the officer's decision to appeal to such a hearing examiner.
    
    (c)  The hearing examiner's decision is final and binding on all parties.  If a campus peace officer elects to appeal the institution's action to an independent third party hearing examiner under this section, the officer or institution may appeal the examiner's decision to a district court only as provided by Subsection (j).
    
    (d)  If a campus peace officer elects to appeal to a hearing examiner, the officer and the head of the institution's law enforcement agency or their designees shall attempt to agree on the selection of an impartial hearing examiner.  If the parties do not agree on the selection of a hearing examiner before the 10th day after the date the appeal is filed, the parties immediately shall request a list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, or their successors in function.  The officer and the agency head or their designees may agree on one of the seven neutral arbitrators on the list.  If the parties do not agree before the fifth business day after the date the parties receive the list, the parties or their designees shall alternate striking a name from the list, and the single name remaining after all other names have been struck is selected as the hearing examiner.  The parties or their designees shall agree on a date for the hearing.
    
    (e)  The appeal hearing must begin as soon as an appearance by the hearing examiner can be scheduled.  If the hearing examiner cannot begin the hearing before the 45th day after the date of selection, the campus peace officer may, within 48 hours after learning of that fact, call for the selection of a new hearing examiner using the procedure prescribed by Subsection (d).
    
    (f)  In a hearing conducted under this section, the hearing examiner has the same duties and powers that a civil service commission has in conducting a hearing or hearing an appeal under Chapter [143](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143), Local Government Code, including the right to issue subpoenas.  The hearing examiner may:
    
    (1)  order that the campus peace officer be reinstated to the same position or status in which the officer was employed immediately before the demotion, suspension, or termination or, in the case of a promotional bypass, to the position or status with respect to which the officer experienced the bypass; and
    
    (2)  award the officer lost wages and any other compensation lost as a result of the disciplinary action or promotional bypass, as applicable.
    
    (g)  In a hearing conducted under this section, the parties may agree to an expedited hearing procedure.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, in an expedited procedure the hearing examiner shall issue a decision on the appeal not later than the 10th day after the date the hearing is completed.
    
    (h)  In an appeal that does not involve an expedited hearing procedure, the hearing examiner shall make a reasonable effort to issue a decision on the appeal not later than the 30th day after the later of the date the hearing is completed or the briefs are filed.  The hearing examiner's inability to meet the time requirements imposed by this section does not affect the hearing examiner's jurisdiction, the validity of the disciplinary action or promotional bypass, or the hearing examiner's final decision.
    
    (i)  The hearing examiner's fees and expenses shall be paid in equal amounts by the parties.  The costs of a witness shall be paid by the party who calls the witness.
    
    (j)  A district court may hear an appeal of a hearing examiner's decision only on the grounds that the hearing examiner was without jurisdiction or exceeded the examiner's jurisdiction or that the decision was procured by fraud, collusion, or other unlawful means.  An appeal must be brought in the district court having jurisdiction in the municipality in which the institution is located.

    (b)  A student who has achieved a score set by the board on the SAT or ACT is exempt from the requirements of this subchapter.  An exemption under this subsection is effective for the five-year period following the date a student takes the test and achieves the standard set by the board.
    
    (c)  A student who has achieved scores set by the board on the questions developed for end-of-course assessment instruments under Section [39.0233](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.0233)(a) is exempt from the requirements of this subchapter.  The exemption is effective for the three-year period following the date a student takes the last assessment instrument for purposes of this subchapter and achieves the standard set by the board.  This subsection does not apply during any period for which the board designates the questions developed for end-of-course assessment instruments under Section [39.0233](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.0233)(a) as the primary assessment instrument under this subchapter, except that the three-year period described by this subsection remains in effect for students who qualify for an exemption under this subsection before that period.
    
    (d)  A student who has demonstrated the performance standard for college readiness as provided by Section [28.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=28.008) on the postsecondary readiness assessment instruments adopted under Section [39.0238](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.0238) for Algebra II and English III, as that section existed before repeal by H.B. 4545, Acts of the 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021, is exempt from the requirements of this subchapter with respect to those content areas.  The commissioner of higher education by rule shall establish the period for which an exemption under this subsection is valid.
    
    (e)  A student who successfully completes a college preparatory course under Section [28.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=28.014) is exempt from the requirements of this subchapter with respect to the content area of the course, provided that the student satisfies the requirements of Subsection (f) of this section.  The exemption is effective for the two-year period following the date the student graduates from high school.  The exemption applies only at the institution of higher education that partners with the school district in which the student is enrolled to provide the course, except that the commissioner of higher education by rule may determine the manner in which the exemption may be applied to institutions of higher education other than the partnering institution.
    
    (f)  A student receiving an exemption under Subsection (e) must enroll in a college-level course in the exempted content area during the student's first year of enrollment at an institution of higher education occurring after the student qualifies for the exemption. If the student earns a grade below a "C" for the course, the institution shall advise the student of non-course-based options for attaining college readiness, such as tutoring or accelerated learning.
    
    (g)  The board shall:
    
    (1)  collect and analyze data regarding the effectiveness of college preparatory courses provided under Section [28.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=28.014) in assisting students to become ready to perform freshman-level academic coursework, as measured by the rate at which students receiving an exemption under Subsection (e) successfully complete the course described by Subsection (f); and
    
    (2)  in November of each even-numbered year, submit a report of the board's findings to the governor, the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, the standing legislative committees with primary jurisdiction over higher education, and each institution of higher education and school district that offers a college preparatory course under Section [28.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=28.014).
    
    (h)  A student who has achieved a score set by the board on a high school equivalency examination administered under Section [7.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=7.111) is exempt from the requirements of this subchapter.  The commissioner of higher education by rule shall establish the period for which an exemption under this subsection is valid.

    Sec. 51.355.  NONVOTING STUDENT REGENT; UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BOARD OF REGENTS.  (a)  In this section, "student government" means the representative student organization directly elected by the student body of a general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit.
    
    (b)  The chancellor of each university system shall develop a uniform application form to be used by each general academic teaching institution and medical and dental unit in the university system to solicit applicants for the position of student regent.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), not later than November 1 of each year, the student government of each general academic teaching institution and medical and dental unit in a university system shall solicit applicants for appointment to the next regular term of the position of student regent.  Not later than January 1, from among the applications received by the student government, the student government shall select five applicants as the student government's recommendations for the position of student regent and send the applications of those applicants to the chancellor of the university system.  From among those applicants, the chancellor shall select two or more applicants as the university system's recommendations for the position of student regent and shall send the applications of those applicants to the governor not later than February 1.  The governor may request to review all applications for the position of student regent received by the student governments and may request an applicant to submit additional information to the governor.  On June 1, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the governor shall appoint one of the applicants to serve as the student regent for the system for a one-year term expiring on the next May 31.  The governor is not required to appoint an applicant recommended by the chancellor, but may not appoint a student regent who did not submit an application to the student government of a general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit in the system as described by this subsection.
    
    (d)  To be eligible for appointment as student regent, a person must be enrolled as an undergraduate or graduate student in a general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit in the university system and be in good academic standing as determined by the institution at the time of appointment.  The person must remain enrolled at the institution throughout the person's term as a student regent.  For purposes of this subsection, a person is considered to be enrolled in an institution or unit for a summer term if the person was enrolled in the institution or unit for the preceding semester and:
    
    (1)  is registered or preregistered at the institution or unit for the following fall semester;
    
    (2)  if the person has not completed the person's degree program, is eligible to continue the degree program at the institution or unit in the following fall semester; or
    
    (3)  if the person completed a degree program in the preceding semester, is admitted to another degree program at the institution or unit for the following fall semester.
    
    (d-1)  Throughout a student regent's term, the student regent must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.5 on a four-point scale.  The president of the institution in which the student regent is enrolled shall notify the governor if the student regent fails to maintain the qualifications required by this section.
    
    (e)  A student regent is not a member of the board of regents of the system for which the student regent is appointed.  A student regent has the same powers and duties as the members of the board of regents of the system, including the right to attend and participate in meetings of the board of regents, except that the student regent:
    
    (1)  may not vote on any matter before the board or make or second any motion before the board; and
    
    (2)  is not counted in determining whether a quorum exists for a meeting of the board or in determining the outcome of any vote of the board.
    
    (f)  The student government of the general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit at which a current student regent was enrolled at the time of the student regent's appointment may not solicit applicants for the position of student regent for the next regular term of the position.
    
    (g)  A vacancy in the position of student regent for a university system shall be filled for the unexpired term by appointment by the governor in consultation with the chancellor of the system.
    
    (h)  On receiving notice under Subsection (d-1) from the president of the institution in which the student regent is enrolled that the student regent has failed to maintain the qualifications required by this section, the governor shall declare the position of student regent vacant and as soon as practicable fill the vacancy in the manner prescribed by Subsection (g).
    
    (i)  A student regent serves without compensation but is entitled to be reimbursed for the actual expenses incurred by the student regent in attending the meetings of the board of regents, subject to the approval of the chairman of the board of regents.

    Sec. 51.356.  NONVOTING STUDENT REGENT; INSTITUTION BOARD OF REGENTS.  (a)  This section applies only to a general academic teaching institution that is not a part of a university system.
    
    (b)  In this section, "student government" means the representative student organization directly elected by the student body of a general academic teaching institution.
    
    (c)  The president of a general academic teaching institution shall develop a uniform application form to be used to solicit applicants for the position of student regent.
    
    (d)  Not later than November 1 of each year, the student government of the general academic teaching institution shall solicit applicants for appointment to the next regular term of the position of student regent.  Not later than January 1, from among the applications received by the student government, the student government shall select five applicants as the student government's recommendations for the position of student regent and send the applications of those applicants to the president of the institution.  From among those applicants, the president shall select two or more applicants as the institution's recommendations for the position of student regent and shall send the applications of those applicants to the governor not later than February 1.  The governor may request to review all applications for the position of student regent received by the student government and may request an applicant to submit additional information to the governor.  On June 1, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the governor shall appoint one of the applicants to serve as the student regent for the institution for a one-year term expiring on the next May 31.  The governor is not required to appoint an applicant recommended by the president, but may not appoint a student regent who did not submit an application to the student government of the institution as described by this subsection.
    
    (e)  To be eligible for appointment as student regent, a person must be enrolled as an undergraduate or graduate student in the general academic teaching institution and be in good academic standing as determined by the institution at the time of appointment.  The person must remain enrolled at the institution throughout the person's term as a student regent.  For purposes of this subsection, a person is considered to be enrolled in an institution for a summer term if the person was enrolled in the institution for the preceding semester and:
    
    (1)  is registered or preregistered at the institution for the following fall semester;
    
    (2)  if the person has not completed the person's degree program, is eligible to continue the degree program at the institution in the following fall semester; or
    
    (3)  if the person completed a degree program in the preceding semester, is admitted to another degree program at the institution for the following fall semester.
    
    (e-1)  Throughout a student regent's term, the student regent must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.5 on a four-point scale.  The president of the institution in which the student regent is enrolled shall notify the governor if the student regent fails to maintain the qualifications required by this section.
    
    (f)  A student regent is not a member of the board of regents of the institution for which the student regent is appointed.  A student regent has the same powers and duties as the members of the board of regents of the institution, including the right to attend and participate in meetings of the board of regents, except that the student regent:
    
    (1)  may not vote on any matter before the board or make or second any motion before the board; and
    
    (2)  is not counted in determining whether a quorum exists for a meeting of the board or in determining the outcome of any vote of the board.
    
    (g)  A vacancy in the position of student regent for an institution shall be filled for the unexpired term by appointment by the governor in consultation with the president of the institution.
    
    (h)  On receiving notice under Subsection (e-1) from the president of the institution that the student regent has failed to maintain the qualifications required by this section, the governor shall declare the position of student regent vacant and as soon as practicable fill the vacancy in the manner prescribed by Subsection (g).
    
    (i)  A student regent serves without compensation but is entitled to be reimbursed for the actual expenses incurred by the student regent in attending the meetings of the board of regents, subject to the approval of the chairman of the board of regents.

    SUBCHAPTER P. FUND FOR THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MANUFACTURING SCIENCES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 51.701.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  strength in the manufacturing sector is critical to the United States' and Texas' international competitive position, as well as to the national security.  Manufacturing has the highest economic multiplier of any industrial sector, contributing to economic growth and personal wealth.  High technology manufacturing has the highest economic multiplier among manufacturing sectors;
    
    (2)  the health of the manufacturing sector is critical for economic growth in Texas.  Texas, as a primary producer of raw materials, finds itself positioned to benefit tremendously from improvement and development of its manufacturing capabilities, even while the Texas economy suffers the consequences of having depended too heavily on production of raw materials alone;  and
    
    (3)  manufacturing industry sales growth and productivity increases have been shown to move in direct relation to the performance of research and development by the industry.

    (e)  The board or its representative shall publish the request for qualifications in a manner prescribed by the board.
    
    (f)  The board or its representative shall evaluate statements of qualifications and select a design-build firm in two phases:
    
    (1)  In phase one, the board or its representative shall prepare a request for qualifications and evaluate each offeror's experience, technical competence, and capability to perform, the past performance of the offeror's team and members of the team, and other appropriate factors submitted by the team or firm in response to the request for qualifications, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted.  Each offeror must certify to the board that each engineer or architect that is a member of its team was selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications in the manner provided by Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code.

    (2)  In phase two, the board or its representative shall evaluate the information submitted by the offerors on the basis of the selection criteria stated in the request for qualifications and the results of any interview.  The board or its representative may request additional information regarding demonstrated competence and qualifications, considerations of the safety and long-term durability of the project, the feasibility of implementing the project as proposed, the ability of the offeror to meet schedules, costing methodology, or other factors as appropriate.  The board or its representative may not require offerors to submit detailed engineering or architectural designs as part of the proposal.  The board or its representative shall rank each proposal submitted on the basis of the criteria specified in the request for qualifications.  The board or its representative shall select the design-build firm that submits the proposal offering the best value for the institution on the basis of the published selection criteria and on its ranking evaluations.  The board or its representative shall first attempt to negotiate with the selected offeror a contract.  If the board or its representative is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the selected offeror, the institution shall, formally and in writing, end all negotiations with that offeror and proceed to negotiate with the next offeror in the order of the selection ranking until a contract is reached or negotiations with all ranked offerors end.
    
    (g)  Following selection of a design-build firm under Subsection (f), that firm's engineers or architects shall complete the design, submitting all design elements for review and determination of scope compliance by the institution's engineer or architect before or concurrently with construction.
    
    (h)  An engineer shall have responsibility for compliance with the engineering design requirements and all other applicable requirements of Chapter [1001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001), Occupations Code.  An architect shall have responsibility for compliance with the requirements of Chapter [1051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1051), Occupations Code.
    
    (i)  The institution shall provide or contract for, independently of the design-build firm, the inspection services, the testing of construction materials engineering, and the verification testing services necessary for acceptance of the facility by the institution.  The institution shall select those services for which it contracts in accordance with Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code.
    
    (j)  The design-build firm shall supply a signed and sealed set of construction documents for the project to the institution at the conclusion of construction.
    
    (k)  A payment or performance bond is not required for, and may not provide coverage for, the portion of a design-build contract under this section that includes design services only.  If a fixed contract amount or guaranteed maximum price has not been determined at the time a design-build contract is awarded, the penal sums of the performance and payment bonds delivered to the institution shall each be in an amount equal to the project budget, as specified in the design criteria package.  The design-build firm shall deliver the bonds not later than the 10th day after the date the design-build firm executes the contract unless the design-build firm furnishes a bid bond or other financial security acceptable to the institution to ensure that the design-build firm will furnish the required performance and payment bonds when a guaranteed maximum price is established.

    Sec. 51.782.  CONTRACTS FOR FACILITIES:  CONSTRUCTION MANAGER-AT-RISK.  (a)  An institution may use the construction manager-at-risk method for the construction, rehabilitation, alteration, or repair of a facility.  In using that method and in entering into a contract for the services of a construction manager-at-risk, a board shall follow the procedures prescribed by this section.
    
    (b)  A construction manager-at-risk is a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity that assumes the risk for construction, rehabilitation, alteration, or repair of a facility at the contracted price as a general contractor and provides consultation to the institution regarding construction during and after the design of the facility.
    
    (c)  Before or concurrently with selecting a construction manager-at-risk, the board shall select or designate an engineer or architect who shall prepare the construction documents for the project and who has full responsibility for complying with Chapter [1001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001) or [1051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1051), Occupations Code, as applicable.  If the engineer or architect is not a full-time employee of the institution, the board shall select the engineer or architect on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications as provided by Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code.  The institution's engineer, architect, or construction manager-agent for a project may not serve, alone or in combination with another, as the construction manager-at-risk unless the engineer or architect is hired to serve as the construction manager-at-risk under a separate or concurrent procurement conducted in accordance with this subchapter.  This subsection does not prohibit the institution's engineer or architect from providing customary construction phase services under the engineer's or architect's original professional service agreement in accordance with applicable licensing laws.
    
    (d)  The board shall provide or contract for, independently of the construction manager-at-risk, the inspection services, the testing of construction materials engineering, and the verification testing services necessary for acceptance of the facility by the institution.  The board shall select those services for which it contracts in accordance with Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code.
    
    (e)  The board shall select the construction manager-at-risk in either a one-step or two-step process.  The board shall prepare a request for proposals, in the case of a one-step process, or a request for qualifications, in the case of a two-step process, that includes general information on the project site, project scope, schedule, selection criteria, estimated budget, and the time and place for receipt of proposals or qualifications, as applicable, a statement as to whether the selection process is a one-step or two-step process, and other information that may assist the board in its selection of a construction manager-at-risk.  The board shall state the selection criteria in the request for proposals or qualifications, as applicable.  The selection criteria may include the offeror's experience, past performance, safety record, proposed personnel and methodology, and other appropriate factors that demonstrate the capability of the construction manager-at-risk.  If a one-step process is used, the board may request, as part of the offeror's proposal, proposed fees and prices for fulfilling the general conditions.  If a two-step process is used, the board may not request fees or prices in step one.  In step two, the board may request that five or fewer offerors, selected solely on the basis of qualifications, provide additional information, including the construction manager-at-risk's proposed fee and its price for fulfilling the general conditions.
    
    (f)  The board shall publish the request for qualifications in a manner prescribed by the board.
    
    (g)  At each step, the board shall receive, publicly open, and read aloud the names of the offerors.  At the appropriate step, the board shall also read aloud the fees and prices, if any, stated in each proposal as the proposal is opened.  Within 45 days after the date of opening the proposals, the board or its representative shall evaluate and rank each proposal submitted in relation to the criteria set forth in the request for proposals.
    
    (h)  The board or its representative shall select the offeror that submits the proposal that offers the best value for the institution based on the published selection criteria and on its ranking evaluation.  The board or its representative shall first attempt to negotiate with the selected offeror a contract.  If the board or its representative is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the selected offeror, the board or its representative shall, formally and in writing, end negotiations with that offeror and proceed to negotiate with the next offeror in the order of the selection ranking until a contract is reached or negotiations with all ranked offerors end.
    
    (i)  A construction manager-at-risk shall publicly advertise, in the manner prescribed by the institution, and receive bids or proposals from trade contractors or subcontractors for the performance of all major elements of the work other than general conditions work.  A construction manager-at-risk may seek to perform major elements of the work itself if the construction manager-at-risk submits its bid or proposal for that work in the same manner as all other trade contractors or subcontractors and if the board determines that the construction manager-at-risk's bid or proposal provides the best value for the institution.  If no satisfactory bid or proposal for a major element of the work is received in the time allowed, the board may negotiate directly with the construction manager-at-risk for performance of that work.  The board may negotiate directly with the manager-at-risk for the performance of minor elements of the work that are not included in major work packages.
    
    (j)  The construction manager-at-risk and the board or its representative shall review all trade contractor or subcontractor bids or proposals in a manner that does not disclose the contents of the bid or proposal during the selection process to a person not employed by the construction manager-at-risk, engineer, architect, or institution.  All bids or proposals shall be made public after the award of the contract or within seven days after the date of final selection of bids and proposals, whichever is later.
    
    (k)  If the construction manager-at-risk reviews, evaluates, and recommends to the board a bid or proposal from a trade contractor or subcontractor but the board requires another bid or proposal to be accepted, the institution shall compensate the construction manager-at-risk by a change in price, time, or guaranteed maximum cost for any additional cost and risk that the construction manager-at-risk may incur because of the board's requirement that another bid or proposal be accepted.
    
    (l)  If a selected trade contractor or subcontractor defaults in the performance of its work or fails to execute a subcontract after being selected in accordance with this section, the construction manager-at-risk may, without advertising, itself fulfill the contract requirements or select a replacement trade contractor or subcontractor to fulfill the contract requirements.
    
    (m)  If a fixed contract amount or guaranteed maximum price has not been determined at the time the contract is awarded, the penal sums of the performance and payment bonds delivered to the institution must each be in an amount equal to the project budget, as set forth in the request for qualifications.

The board shall state in the request for proposals the selection criteria that will be used in selecting the successful offeror.
    
    (e)  The board shall publish notice of the request for proposals in a manner prescribed by the board.
    
    (f)  The board shall receive, publicly open, and read aloud the names of the offerors and, if any are required to be stated, all prices stated in each proposal.  Within 45 days after the date of opening the proposals the board shall evaluate and rank each proposal submitted in relation to the published selection criteria.
    
    (g)  The board shall select the offeror that offers the best value for the institution based on the published selection criteria and on its ranking evaluation.  The board shall first attempt to negotiate with the selected offeror a contract.  The board and its engineer or architect may discuss with the selected offeror options for a scope or time modification and any price change associated with the modification. If the board is unable to reach a contract with the selected offeror, the board shall, formally and in writing, end negotiations with that offeror and proceed to the next offeror in the order of the selection ranking until a contract is reached or all proposals are rejected.
    
    (h)  In determining best value for the institution, the board is not restricted to considering price alone but may consider any other factor stated in the selection criteria.

    (b)  The institution may establish contractual unit prices for a job order contract by:
    
    (1)  specifying one or more published construction unit price books and the applicable divisions or line items;  or
    
    (2)  providing a list of work items and requiring the offerors to bid or propose one or more coefficients or multipliers to be applied to the price book or work items as the price proposal.
    
    (c)  The board shall advertise for, receive, and publicly open sealed proposals for job order contracts.
    
    (d)  The board may require offerors to submit additional information besides rates, including experience, past performance, and proposed personnel and methodology.

    (f)  An order for a job or project under the job order contract must be signed by the board's representative and the contractor.  The order may be a fixed price, lump-sum contract based substantially on contractual unit pricing applied to estimated quantities or may be a unit price order based on the quantities and line items delivered.
    
    (g)  The contractor shall provide payment and performance bonds, if required by law, based on the amount or estimated amount of any order.
    
    (h)  The base term of a job order contract is for the period and with any renewal options that the institution sets forth in the request for proposals.  If the institution fails to advertise that term, the base term may not exceed two years and is not renewable without further advertisement and solicitation of proposals.

    (a-1)  Beginning with admissions for the 2011-2012 academic year, The University of Texas at Austin is not required to offer admission to applicants who qualify for automatic admission under Subsection (a) in excess of the number required to fill 75 percent of the university's enrollment capacity designated for first-time resident undergraduate students in an academic year.  If the number of applicants who qualify for automatic admission to The University of Texas at Austin under Subsection (a) for an academic year exceeds 75 percent of the university's enrollment capacity designated for first-time resident undergraduate students for that academic year, the university may elect to offer admission to those applicants as provided by this subsection and not as otherwise required by Subsection (a).  If the university elects to offer admission under this subsection, the university shall offer admission to those applicants by percentile rank according to high school graduating class standing based on grade point average, beginning with the top percentile rank, until the applicants qualified under Subsection (a) have been offered admission in the number estimated in good faith by the university as sufficient to fill 75 percent of the university's enrollment capacity designated for first-time resident undergraduate students, except that the university must offer admission to all applicants with the same percentile rank.  After the applicants qualified for automatic admission under Subsection (a) have been offered admission under this subsection in the number estimated in good faith as sufficient to fill 75 percent of the designated enrollment capacity described by this subsection, the university shall consider any remaining applicants qualified for automatic admission under Subsection (a) in the same manner as other applicants for admission as first-time undergraduate students in accordance with Section [51.805](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=51.805).
    
    (a-2)  If the number of applicants who apply to a general academic teaching institution during the current academic year for admission in the next academic year and who qualify for automatic admission to a general academic teaching institution under Subsection (a) exceeds 75 percent of the institution's enrollment capacity designated for first-time resident undergraduate students for that next academic year and the institution plans to offer admission under Subsection (a-1) during the next school year, the institution shall, in the manner prescribed by the Texas Education Agency and not later than September 15, provide to each school district, for dissemination of the information to high school junior-level students and their parents, notice of which percentile ranks of high school senior-level students who qualify for automatic admission under Subsection (a) are anticipated by the institution to be offered admission under Subsection (a-1) during the next school year.
    
    (a-3)  Repealed by Acts 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., Ch. 776 , Sec. 1, eff. June 17, 2015.
    
    (a-4)  If The University of Texas at Austin elects to offer admission to first-time resident undergraduate students under Subsection (a-1) for an academic year, the university must continue its practice of not considering an applicant's legacy status as a factor in the university's decisions relating to admissions for that academic year.
    
    (a-5)  A general academic teaching institution that offers admission to first-time resident undergraduate students under Subsection (a-1) shall require that a student admitted under that subsection complete a designated portion of not less than six semester credit hours of the student's coursework during evening hours or other low-demand hours as necessary to ensure the efficient use of the institution's available classrooms.
    
    (a-6)  Not later than December 31 of each academic year in which The University of Texas at Austin offers admission under Subsection (a-1), the university shall deliver a written report to the governor, the lieutenant governor, and speaker of the house of representatives regarding the university's progress in each of the following matters:
    
    (1)  increasing geographic diversity of the entering freshman class;
    
    (2)  counseling and outreach efforts aimed at students qualified for automatic admission under this section;
    
    (3)  recruiting Texas residents who graduate from other institutions of higher education to the university's graduate and professional degree programs;
    
    (4)  recruiting students who are members of underrepresented demographic segments of the state's population; and
    
    (5)  assessing and improving the university's regional recruitment centers.
    
    (b)  An applicant who does not satisfy the curriculum requirements prescribed by Subsection (a)(2)(A)(i) or (ii) is considered to have satisfied those requirements if the student completed the portion of the distinguished level of achievement under the foundation high school program curriculum or of the curriculum equivalent in content and rigor, as applicable, that was available to the student but was unable to complete the remainder of the curriculum solely because courses necessary to complete the remainder were unavailable to the student at the appropriate times in the student's high school career as a result of course scheduling, lack of enrollment capacity, or another cause not within the student's control.
    
    (c)  To qualify for admission under this section, an applicant must:
    
    (1)  submit an application before the expiration of any application filing deadline established by the institution; and

    (2)  if Subsection (b) applies to the student, whether the student has completed the portion of the distinguished level of achievement under the foundation high school program curriculum or of the curriculum equivalent in content and rigor, as applicable, that was available to the student.
    
    (d-1)  In addition to admissions required under Subsection (a), each general academic teaching institution shall admit an applicant for admission to the institution as an undergraduate student if the applicant graduated as the valedictorian of the student's high school graduating class in one of the two school years preceding the academic year for which the student is applying for admission and satisfies the requirements of Subsections (a)(1) through (3).  Subsection (b) applies to an applicant for admission under this subsection.  An applicant admitted under this subsection is considered automatically admitted for purposes of Subsection (a), (a-1), or (a-2), as applicable.
    
    (e)  Each institution of higher education shall admit an applicant for admission to the institution as an undergraduate student if the applicant:
    
    (1)  is the child of a public servant listed in Section [615.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=615.003), Government Code, who was killed or sustained a fatal injury in the line of duty; and
    
    (2)  meets the minimum requirements, if any, established for purposes of this subsection by the governing board of the institution for high school or prior college-level grade point average and performance on standardized tests.
    
    (f)  After admitting an applicant under this section, the institution shall review the applicant's record and any other factor the institution considers appropriate to determine whether the applicant may require additional preparation for college-level work or would benefit from inclusion in a retention program.  The institution may require a student so identified to enroll during the summer immediately after the student is admitted under this section to participate in appropriate enrichment courses and orientation programs.  This section does not prohibit a student who is not determined to need additional preparation for college-level work from enrolling, if the student chooses, during the summer immediately after the student is admitted under this section.
    
    (g)  The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board by rule shall develop and implement a program to increase and enhance the efforts of general academic teaching institutions in conducting outreach to academically high-performing high school seniors in this state who are likely to be eligible for automatic admission under Subsection (a) to provide to those students information and counseling regarding the operation of this section and other opportunities, including financial assistance, available to those students for success at public institutions of higher education in this state.  Under the program, the coordinating board, after gathering information and recommendations from available sources and examining current outreach practices by institutions in this state and in other states, shall prescribe best practices guidelines and standards to be used by general academic teaching institutions in conducting the student outreach described by this subsection.
    
    (h)  An institution that admits under this section an applicant qualified for automatic admission under Subsection (a) or (d-1) may admit the applicant for either the fall semester of the academic year for which the applicant applies or for the summer session preceding that fall semester, as determined by the institution.
    
    (i)  If a general academic teaching institution denies admission to an applicant for an academic year, in any letter or other communication the institution provides to the applicant notifying the applicant of that denial, the institution may not reference the provisions of this section, including using a description of a provision of this section such as the top 10 percent automatic admissions law, as a reason the institution is unable to offer admission to the applicant unless the number of applicants for admission to the institution for that academic year who qualify for automatic admission under Subsection (a) is sufficient to fill 100 percent of the institution's enrollment capacity designated for first-time resident undergraduate students.
    
    (j)  A general academic teaching institution that elects to offer admission under Subsection (a-1) for an academic year may not offer admission to first-time undergraduate students who are not residents of this state for that academic year in excess of the number required to fill 10 percent of the institution's enrollment capacity designated for first-time undergraduate students for that academic year.

    Sec. 51.842.  ADMISSION AND SCHOLARSHIP FACTORS FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS.  (a)  A graduate or professional program of a general academic teaching institution or medical or dental unit may consider the following factors in making an admissions or scholarship decision for admissions into or competitive scholarships for the graduate or professional program:
    
    (1)  an applicant's academic record as a high school student and undergraduate student;
    
    (2)  the socioeconomic background of the applicant while the applicant attended elementary and secondary school and was an undergraduate student, including any change in that background;
    
    (3)  whether the applicant would be the first generation of the applicant's family to attend or graduate from an undergraduate program or from a graduate or professional program;
    
    (4)  whether the applicant has multilingual proficiency;
    
    (5)  the applicant's responsibilities while attending elementary and secondary school and as an undergraduate student, including whether the applicant was employed, whether the applicant helped to raise children, and other similar factors;
    
    (6)  to achieve geographic diversity, the applicant's region of residence at the time of application and, if the applicant graduated from a public high school in this state within the preceding 20 years, the region in which the applicant's school district is located;
    
    (7)  the applicant's involvement in community activities;
    
    (8)  the applicant's demonstrated commitment to a particular field of study;
    
    (9)  for admission into a professional program, the current comparative availability of members of that profession in the applicant's region of residence while the applicant attended elementary and secondary school;
    
    (10)  whether the applicant was automatically admitted to a general academic teaching institution as an undergraduate student under Section [51.803](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=51.803);  and
    
    (11)  the applicant's personal interview.
    
    (b)  An applicant's performance on a standardized test may not be used in the admissions or competitive scholarship process for a graduate or professional program as the sole criterion for consideration of the applicant or as the primary criterion to end consideration of the applicant.  If an applicant's performance on a standardized test is used in the admissions or competitive scholarship process, the applicant's performance must also be used to compare the applicant's test score with those of other applicants from similar socioeconomic backgrounds to the extent that those backgrounds can be properly determined and identified by the general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit based on information provided in the institution's or unit's admissions or competitive scholarship process.  This subsection does not apply to a standardized test used to measure the English language proficiency of a student who is a graduate of a foreign institution of higher education.
    
    (c)  A general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit may not assign a specific weight to any one factor being considered in the admissions or competitive scholarship process for a graduate or professional program.
    
    (d)  Not later than one year before the date that applications for admissions and competitive scholarships are first considered for a graduate or professional program under this subchapter, each general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit shall publish in the catalog of the institution or unit a description of the factors to be considered by the institution or unit in making those admissions and competitive scholarship decisions and shall make the information available to the public.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), if compliance with requirements of an accrediting agency effectively prevent a general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit from timely publishing the factors to be considered in admissions decisions, the institution may delay publication of the factors, but shall publish the factors as soon as practicable when compliance with accrediting agency requirements permits.

    (b)  The governing board of an institution of higher education may enter into an energy savings performance contract in accordance with this section.
    
    (c)  Each energy or water conservation measure must comply with current local, state, and federal construction, plumbing, and environmental codes and regulations.  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), an energy savings performance contract may not include improvements or equipment that allow or cause water from any condensing, cooling, or industrial process or any system of nonpotable usage over which the public water supply system officials do not have sanitary control, to be returned to the potable water supply.
    
    (d)  The board may enter into energy savings performance contracts only with entities that are experienced in the design, implementation, and installation of the energy or water conservation measures addressed by the contract.
    
    (e)  Before entering into an energy savings performance contract, the board shall require the provider of the energy or water conservation measures to file with the board a payment and performance bond in accordance with Chapter [2253](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2253), Government Code.  The board may also require a separate bond to cover the value of the guaranteed savings on the contract.
    
    (f)  The board may enter into an energy savings performance contract for a period of more than one year only if the board finds that the amount the institution would spend on the energy or water conservation measures will not exceed the amount to be saved in energy, water, wastewater, and operating costs over 20 years from the date of installation.  If the term of the contract exceeds one year, the institution's contractual obligation in any year during the term of the contract beginning after the final date of installation may not exceed the total energy, water, wastewater, and operating cost savings, including electrical, gas, water, wastewater, or other utility cost savings and operating cost savings resulting from the measures, as determined by the board in this subsection, divided by the number of years in the contract term beginning after the final date of installation.  The board shall consider all costs of the energy or water conservation measures, including costs of design, engineering, installation, maintenance, repairs, and debt service.
    
    (g)  An energy savings performance contract may be financed:
    
    (1)  under a lease/purchase contract that has a term not to exceed 20 years from the final date of installation and that meets federal tax requirements for tax-free municipal leasing or long-term financing, including a lease/purchase contract under the master equipment lease purchase program administered by the Texas Public Finance Authority under Chapter [1232](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1232), Government Code;
    
    (2)  with the proceeds of bonds; or
    
    (3)  under a contract with the provider of the energy or water conservation measures that has a term not to exceed the lesser of 20 years from the final date of installation or the average useful life of the energy or water conservation or usage measures.
    
    (g-1)  Notwithstanding other law, the board may use any available money to pay the provider of the energy or water conservation measures under this section, and the board is not required to pay for such costs solely out of the savings realized by the institution of higher education under an energy savings performance contract.  The board may contract with the provider to perform work that is related to, connected with, or otherwise ancillary to the measures identified in the scope of an energy savings performance contract.
    
    (h)  An energy savings performance contract shall contain provisions requiring the provider of the energy or water conservation measures to guarantee the amount of the savings to be realized by the institution of higher education under the contract.
    
    (i)  An energy savings performance contract shall be let according to the procedures established for procuring certain professional services by Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code.  Notice of the request for qualifications shall be given in the manner provided by Section [2156.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2156.002), Government Code.  The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, in consultation with the State Energy Conservation Office with regard to energy and water conservation measures, shall establish guidelines and an approval process for awarding energy savings performance contracts.  The guidelines must require that the cost savings projected by an offeror be reviewed by a licensed professional engineer who has a minimum of three years of experience in energy calculation and review, is not an officer or employee of an offeror for the contract under review, and is not otherwise associated with the contract.  In conducting the review, the engineer shall focus primarily on the proposed improvements from an engineering perspective, the methodology and calculations related to cost savings, increases in revenue, and, if applicable, efficiency or accuracy of metering equipment.  An engineer who reviews a contract shall maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information the engineer acquires while reviewing the contract.  A contract is not required to be reviewed or approved by the State Energy Conservation Office.  Sections [1001.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001.053) and [1001.407](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001.407), Occupations Code, apply to work performed under the contract.
    
    (j)  The legislature shall base an institution's appropriation for energy, water, and wastewater costs during a fiscal year on the sum of:
    
    (1)  the institution's estimated energy, water, and wastewater costs for that fiscal year;  and
    
    (2)  if an energy savings performance contract is in effect, the institution's estimated net savings resulting from the contract during the contract term, divided by the number of years in the contract term.
    
    (k)  Chapter [2269](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2269), Government Code, does not apply to this section.
    
    (l)  The guidelines established under Subsection (i) must require the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to:
    
    (1)  review any reports submitted to the board that measure and verify cost savings to an institution of higher education under an energy savings performance contract; and
    
    (2)  based on the reports, provide an analysis, on a periodic basis, of the cost savings under the energy savings performance contract to the governing board of the institution of higher education and the Legislative Budget Board until the governing board of the institution of higher education determines that the analysis is no longer required to accurately measure cost savings.
