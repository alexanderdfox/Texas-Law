If the home service provider determines that the amount of tax imposed or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is incorrect, the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit any amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer.  The home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer for a period of up to four years.

The home service provider shall reflect changes made to such database during a calendar quarter not later than 30 days after the end of such calendar quarter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  If neither the state nor the designated database provider provides an electronic database as described in Subsection (a)(3), a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability in the state that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing jurisdiction if, subject to Subsection (n), the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction for each level of taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence at each level of taxing jurisdiction to ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction.  If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code for each level of taxing jurisdiction.  Any enhanced zip code assignment changed in accordance with Subsection (n) is deemed to be in compliance with this section.  For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised due diligence if such home service provider demonstrates that it has:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of such database.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  Subsection (j) applies to a home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements of Subsection (j), if an electronic database as defined in Subsection (a)(3) is not provided until the later of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  18 months after the nationwide standard numeric code described in Subsection (a)(3) has been approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  6 months after the state or a designated database provider in the state provides such database as prescribed in Subsection (a)(3).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  A home service provider shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining the customer's place of primary use as defined in Subsection (a)(2).  Subject to Subsection (n), and if the home service provider's reliance on information provided by its customer is in good faith, a taxing jurisdiction shall:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  allow a home service provider to rely on the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the home service provider's customer;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  not hold a home service provider liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees based on a different determination of the place of primary use for taxes, charges, or fees that are customarily passed on to the customer as a separate itemized charge.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  Except as provided in Subsection (n), a taxing jurisdiction shall allow a home service provider to treat the address used by the home service provider for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract or agreement in effect two years after the date of the enactment of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Sections 116-126) as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement, for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees on charges for mobile telecommunications services are remitted.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  The state may:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  determine that the address used for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees for mobile telecommunications services are remitted does not meet the definition of place of primary use under Subsection (a)(2) and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the place of primary use on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination.  Before the state gives such notice of determination, the customer shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable state administrative procedures that the address is the customer's place of primary use;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  determine that the assignment of a taxing jurisdiction by a home service provider under Subsection (j) does not reflect the correct taxing jurisdiction and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the assignment on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination.  The home service provider shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable state administrative procedures that the assignment reflects the correct taxing jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)(1) If a taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation and if these charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges that are subject to taxation, then the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services may be subject to taxation unless the home service provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to such tax, charge, or fee from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  If a taxing jurisdiction does not subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation, a customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for mobile telecommunications services unless the customer's home service provider separately states the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services from taxable charges or the home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the home service provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges.</p>
